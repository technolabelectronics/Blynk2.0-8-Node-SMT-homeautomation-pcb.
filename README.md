# Introduction
In this post we are going to make Android app bluetooth controlled homeautomation system,

For making of this homeautomation system I will use my 8 node SMT homeautomation pcb and coustom design android app... everything is available in this repository.
you can download from there if you wish to make this homeautomation system.

Best part of this project is that we don't need any internet connection or any local server to connect android application and esp32. 
App will directly communicate to the esp32 via bluetooth.

The only down side of this homeautomation system is , it will only work in local range.

If you want to purchase this 8 node SMT homeautomation pcb then connect me.
